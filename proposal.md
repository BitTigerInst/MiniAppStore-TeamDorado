# Mini APP Store

## Description

This project provides an introduction to full-stack web app development using JAVA. Whether you plan to dive deeper into web app development and become a specialist, or you plan to integrate other work with web applications, a basic foundation in full stack development will be very helpful. In this project, we are going build a web application similar to the Google Play or Apple appstore with the goal of providing users with an easy to navigate page where they can browse available apps. The app store will use the following technologies: JAVA using Spring-MVC framework, Hibernate ORM, MySQL (data storage), Tomcat 8.0 (web server), and AngularJS (UX). The major functionalities are fairly simple. App information will be provided in a raw dataset and then loaded into a MySQL database. The final interface will filter the home page to only show the top 10 apps. Finally, if the user wishes to learn more about an app, they will be able to click on an app and be directed to a details page.
